# mSaleaeLogic
A Matlab wrapper for using Saleae Logic Analyzer network interface. Logic Analyzer website: https://www.saleae.com/

Works with Saleae Logic Analayzer 1.2.6. Works on Windows 7, Mac OS El Capitan and Ubuntu 16.04

See example.m for example.

The code was written in a mindset that the Logic application is running on a remote machine, different from the machine running the Matlab code. Obviously, it can also work in case both are on the same machine.
